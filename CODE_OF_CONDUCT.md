Code of Conduct
===============

Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we
are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our
community to be accessible to all: whoever you are, and whatever your
background, we welcome you.


Conduct
-------

* Be welcoming and open-minded. Others may not have the same experience level or
  background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to
  contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming and courteous to others in your
  interactions.

* Assume no malice. We all make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of
  opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that
  people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly
  atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in
  discussions, and making contributions.

* Be clear. Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's
  hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to
  use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other
  person.

* On community channels like IRC and Slack, please avoid usernames that might
  detract from a welcoming environment for all.

* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  That is not welcome behaviour.

* Don't impersonate other people by copying their avatars, posting content under
  their email addressese, using similar usernames or otherwise posing as someone
  else.

* Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private
  email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, or passwords. This
  is also a form of harassment as it may present safety risks or other harms.

* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
  you have been or are being harassed by a community member, please contact one
  of the core team members or any of the moderation team immediately. Whether
  you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
  community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behaviour is not welcome.


Contact
-------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior that
violates our Code of Conduct may be reported by:

* Emailing tav@espians.com.

* Contacting moderators who are present in the venue where the behaviour is
  taking place, e.g. operators in online chat channels, organisers at offline
  meetups, etc.


Moderation
----------

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct:

* Behaviour that violates our standards of conduct is not allowed.

* Behaviour that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
  conduct or not, is also not allowed.

* Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.

* If the warning is unheeded, the person will be temporarily excluded from
  interaction, e.g. by being asked to leave the venue at meetups, by being
  kicked from IRC channels, etc.

* If the person comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
  i.e. indefinitely excluded.

* Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the person if it was a
  first offense and they offer a genuine apology.

* If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
  up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Public
  complaints about bans are not allowed.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all public interaction spaces
where our community is present, e.g. online chat channels, GitHub repositories,
offline meetups/events, etc.
